Ok Ok, first of all , What are collections in Swift? It's simple!

As mentioned in [swift.org](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html) :

> Swift provides three primary collection types (arrays, sets, and dictionaries) for storing collections of values.
>
> 1. Arrays are ordered collections of values.
> 2. Sets are unordered collections of unique values.
> 3. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

... note that these collection types are implemented as _generic types_.

Assuming that you're familiar with at least one of these types, let's get familiar with the hero, Higher Order functions !

### Higher Order functions

They're really simple ! Higher order functions are ones that deal with other functions, either as a _parameter_ or as a _return_ type .

As far as we need them for this series is that there are some higher order functions built by swift for collection types such as .map, .compactMap, .flatMap, .split , .filter, .reduce, .forEach and .sort.

We'd also try to see what our world would be without these lovely functions by example while learning how to make our life easier with them .

_Believe me, they'd make your coding life much easier - swiftier :)_

Learn about **.map**, **.compactMap** and **.flatMap** in the next exciting episode =)
